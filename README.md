# Rails Review

- Generators FTW!
- ActiveRecord
  - Way to model your data layer in Ruby
  - SQL **Magic**!
  - Object Relational Mapping (ORM)
  - Database agnostic
    - It uses adapters to connect to the correct database
- MVC
  - Model-View-Controller
  - Pattern, separates the presentation of our data from the storage of the data
  - Model: `ActiveRecord`
  - View: HTML, JSON, XML, etc.
  - Controller: Connects our data to the view
- Convention over Configuration framework
- Router
  - Defines the routes, and connects them to controllers, but doesn't include the actual code
